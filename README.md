# HRMI_Calculator
Calculates metrics on how well countries meet Human Right Obligations, given their resources.
This calculator uses the SERFindex.org methodology to assess how well countries are meeting 
their economic and social rights obligations that are prescribed in international treaties.
These treaties recognize that countries vary in their resources and so expectations are
different for different countries. The methodology takes these differences into account in
assessing how well countries are doing. 
The data on different countries are available at www.humanrightsmeasurement.org and at
serfindex.org. The calculator is provided for individuals who have available THE SAME TYPE OF
INPUT DATA (which is defined in the calculator) for some specific subgroup of a country. The 
calculator applies the same algorithms that are used in assessing countries.
The .Livecode file has the program. The Calculator4HRMI2023onGithub.zip has the executable zipped
with some helpful files about using the calculator. Calculator_LiveCode_HowToUpdate.docx has an
initial description of the cards, scripts, and their locations for those who will revise the 
calculator in the future. The CalculatorDemo.mp4 is a video demo of calculator use. It was
left out of the zip file because it made it too large for Github.
